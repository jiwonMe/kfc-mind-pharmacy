# Git Repository Setup

Your repository has been initialized and the initial commit has been created.

## To push to GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it: `kfc-mind-pharmacy`
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Create repository

2. **Add the remote and push:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kfc-mind-pharmacy.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:
```bash
gh repo create kfc-mind-pharmacy --public --source=. --push
```

## Current Status
